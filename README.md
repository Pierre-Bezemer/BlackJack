# BlackJack
My First Public Project after learning the basics of Python

My end goal: Making my first working game in Python which requests user input

My sub Goals:
- learning how to make a project using Git and GitHub
- learning how to ask for user input
- learning how to pictures or ASCII-art in Python
- learning how to make a code which resolves its own errors


Current progress:
- 2021-10-16: Creating the GitHub repository and initialising the process (brain storming about which game and some goals to learn from the game)
